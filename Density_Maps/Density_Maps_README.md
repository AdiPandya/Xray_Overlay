# Density Maps

The notebook [Density_Maps_tutorial.ipynb](Density_Maps_tutorial.ipynb) contains the code to create the density maps from their celestial coordinates and save them as fits files with correct WCS information. The density maps can be used to create contours on the X-ray images.

Differnt methods are mentioned in the notebook to create the density maps. A scipt version of the notebook is still in works.
