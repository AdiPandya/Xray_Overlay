# Xray Overlay Guide
-by Aditya Pandya

Guide for creating X-ray overlay on the Optical Images and galaxy density maps for creating contours on the X-ray images.

The folder [XRGB_Image](XRGB_Image) contains the information on how to overlay the X-ray images on the Optical images. Read the file [XRGB_README.md](XRGB_Image/XRGB_README.md) to get started.

The folder [Density_Maps](Density_Maps) contains the information on how to create the galaxy density maps from their celestial coordinates and save them as fits files with correct WCS information. The density maps can be used to create contours on the X-ray images. Read the file [Density_Maps_README.md](Density_Maps/Density_Maps_README.md) to get started.
